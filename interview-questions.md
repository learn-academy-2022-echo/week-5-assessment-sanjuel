# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

Your answer: A hash in Ruby is a unique key that relates to an assigned object or class. It is long, and contains letters and numbers in a random order. This is so that many can be assigned and no one has the same hash.

Researched answer: In ruby, a hash is something that comes from a class, and is represented by key value pairs. It is kind of like an object in the way that you can use methods to create many isntances of a hash out of a class that you create. For example, if i was to create a class named Book, I could instantiate it using the name of the book, the author, and the genre. I could create a Hash by using Book.new, and giving it a name, genre, and author. I could do this with any number of hashes, any create any number of unique books. The deafult state of a hash is nil, until updated. 

2. What is a gem?

Your answer:  A gem is something that we install onto ruby in order for it to have more uses than it comes with out of the box. An example of this would be in ruby testing, or rspec. This needs to be installed, but once you have it it is very useful. 

Researched answer: A gem is  a package that ruby developers will download in order to add more onto what ruby comes standard with. RubyGems is the package manager that people use to do this. One example of this is rpsec, which allows people to test their code, similarly to how yarn works for javascript. Gems are generally used to modify or add onto what ruby, or ruby applications, can already do. 

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

Your answer: Ruby on rails is a way of translating ruby code into a back end program so that we can use it to transfer data. It's kind of like react is to front end, ruby on rails is to back end. 

Researched answer: Ruby on rails is an open source application that allows the use of Ruby to make full stack web applications. It employs the idea that while it may not be as coustomizable, it will provide a framework for everything you will need to do and thus make it a lot easier. It is similar to how many programmers use mac computers, because while something like a PC or linux computer would be far more customizable, that also opens it up to having problems in the future that will be harder to solve. Rails takes this same priciple, but applies it to the code itself. 

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database is one that translates one language into something a database can read, then translates it back so that the programmer can read it. 

Researched answer: A relational database is an idea that when data is stored, you can use relationships between two things to access it. An example of this is in a username that one might create on a website. The customer creates their username, and it is stored as a primary key, but while they do that a copy is made on the hard drive of the websites server somehwere, stored as a foreign key. Now that there is a relationship between these two things, they can have more data that is stored from that primary key and foreign key relationship. There are other kinds of databases, such as a non relational database. 

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Primary keys are in a class what assigns data to something. 

Researched answer: A primary key is used in a relational database to provide a unique key to a user that cannot be replicated. This could be something that is assigned to a username, then stored in a database. This makes it so whenever someone logs into a website, it can use that primary key that is assosiated with that username to pull up all their data. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: A route that maps http verbs to CRUD actions. GET, NEW, SHOW, POST, EDIT, PUT, DELETE

2. JSON: A common data storage format that uses text that humans can read to translate into objects with value pairs. 

3. ERB: A template system that puts ruby into text. This is used to put ruby code into html.

4. Params: A variable that is used to take in something in a function.

5. API: Application programming interface, this is how different computers communicate between one another.
